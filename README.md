# GigFlow React Project

I had the opportunity to build this project for **GigFlow** within a single day, leveraging React and popular libraries such as Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and React Router.  

I am grateful to the GigFlow team for trusting me with this challenge and providing the platform to contribute meaningfully.  

In this project, I implemented key features including dynamic filtering of gig data and exporting the filtered results to CSV format. The focus was on creating a smooth, responsive user experience with clean navigation and subtle animations to enhance usability.
